# **App Name**: Local Finder

## Core Features:

- Vendor Discovery: Allow users to discover local vendors, shops, and businesses within a specified radius, with search filters for categories and keywords.
- Vendor Registration & Management: Enable vendors to register, create profiles, list services, update business information (address, hours, contact details), and upload photos.
- Interactive Map Display: Show vendors on an interactive map interface using Leaflet, with location markers and integrated directions.
- Personalized Recommendations: AI-powered tool that provides users with personalized vendor recommendations based on their location, search history, ratings, and preferences, if available.
- Categorization of Services: Each vendor may designate 1-3 appropriate categories for their offerings (e.g., Restaurants, Auto Repair, Pet Grooming), chosen from a standardized list.
- Favorites: Users can 'favorite' specific vendors in order to view them later or receive notifications (if supported).
- Distance Calculation: Calculate the approximate distance of each vendor from the userâ€™s location. Allow results to be sorted by proximity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3399FF) to convey trust and connection to local environments.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E5F3FF), almost white, for a clean and open feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons, offering a sense of vibrancy.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to offer a blend of modernity and approachability.
- Use outline-style icons to match a clean and modern design. Icons should be intuitive and related to location, business, and services.
- Employ a card-based layout to present vendor listings. Prioritize visual information such as business name, a cover photo, and brief description.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user interaction, such as sliding panels, fading elements, and map marker pop-ups.
